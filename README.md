# NJ-School-Districts---STA215
This is a replication package for a final project in a STA215 class. It examines NJ School districts. We looked all the school districts in New Jersey and analyzed student population, graduation rates, local funding, and teacher's salaries. We sought to figure out how these variables interact to impact graduation rate.
